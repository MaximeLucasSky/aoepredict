# AOEPredict

This is a personal project that uses data read from memory of 
Age of Empires 2 matches in order to make live predictions of
match outcomes. I use data from a server hosted by <aocrecs.com> with data
on several thousand Age of Empires 2 games, primarily Wololo Kingdoms. 

I will try to remeber to keep my environment file up to date but if there
are any issues let me know and I will update it to my current environment

Many thanks to the work done by the people at SiegeEngineers and providing access to the data.
